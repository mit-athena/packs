.SH NAME
syncconf \- synchronize system configuration files with rc.conf
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B syncconf
[
.B \-a
] [
.B \-n
] [
.B \-q
]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I syncconf
script is used to propagate the state of
.I rc.conf
to vendor specific configuration files. This provides the possibility
of a uniform interface for changing common machine configuration
information across many operating systems, and frees system
administrators from the need of remembering esoteric machine specific
procedures.

If ``SYNCCONFIG'' is set to true in
.IR rc.conf ,
.I syncconf
is run automatically early in the boot process and at shutdown time;
.I syncconf should not
normally need to be run by the user.
.I rc.conf
specifies which configuration variables are synchronized by
.IR syncconf .
.SH OPTIONS
.I syncconf
provides three options:
.PP
.TP 8
.B \-a
This option causes
.I syncconf
to synchronize all options, not just the ones which have changed.
.TP 8
.B \-n
This option causes 
.I syncconf
to echo the shell commands it would use to synchronize, but does not
actually execute them.
.TP 8
.B \-q
This option causes
.I syncconf
not to give output on what, if anything, it is synchronizing.
.SH FILES
/etc/athena/rc.conf             Athena configuration file
/etc/athena/.rc.conf.sync       synchronization state file
