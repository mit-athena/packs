# It was discovered that on systems which do not have a /usr/tmp, and are
#	idle much of the time, such as VS2 workstations, the "05 1" & "10 1"
#	lines will delete everything in /tmp.  This allows the "20 1" line
#	to delete /tmp, since there is no /usr/tmp.  This allows "10 1" to
#	delete EVERYTHING on the disk which has not been accessed in 24
#	hours.  AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! From Berkeley.
