NAME=libsoup, an HTTP implementation, for Athena
DESC=libsoup is an HTTP library implementation in C.  libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to the Gtk+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also supported for those who want it).
