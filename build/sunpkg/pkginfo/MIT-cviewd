DESC=cviewd is normally run from inetd and contacted by the cview(1) or xcluster(1) programs.  cviewd reads report files written by larvnetd(8) and displays that information accord- ing to a one-line command read from standard input (the net- work connection).  The valid commands are described in cview(1).
