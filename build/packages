# This file gives the list of packages to build for the release, the
# order they will be built in, and which platforms they will be built
# for.  Each line gives a package name and, optionally, a
# comma-separated list of hosttypes to build the package on.  If the
# list of hosttypes is omitted or contains the word "all", the package
# is built for all platforms.  Blank lines and lines beginning with
# '#' are ignored.

# These tools are critical to the build process and need to be built
# first, even before the packs are set up.  They have .build files
# which don't assume that much of anything is ready.
