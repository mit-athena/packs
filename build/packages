# This file gives the list of packages to build for the release.
# Each line gives a package name and, optionally, additional
# information about when and on what platforms to build the package.
# The possible options are:
#
#	early		build the package early in the build
#	late		build the package late in the build
#	on platform	build the package only on the named platforms
#	except platform	built the package only on platforms not named
#	requires pkg	must be built after the named package
#
#
# The "early" packages will be built first, in the order they appear
# in the file. The "late" packages will be built last, also in the
# order they appear in the file. Other packages may be reordered,
# within the constraints imposed by the "requires" clauses. The "on",
# and "except" options take a comma-separated list of platforms. The
# "requires" option takes a comma-separated list of package names,
# which can be abbreviated to the final pathname component if it is
# unique among packages.
#
# One additional option gives information for building packages in
# package management systems.
#
#	package	NAME	give the package the name athena-NAME
# 
# (The default package name is athena-DIR where DIR is the last
# component of the source directory name.)
#
# Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' are ignored.

# These tools are critical to the build process and need to be built
# first, even before the packs are set up.  They have build systems
# which don't assume that much of anything is ready.
