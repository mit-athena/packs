%description
The findutils package contains programs which will help you locate
files on your system.  The find utility searches through a hierarchy
of directories looking for files which match a certain set of criteria
(such as a filename pattern).  The xargs utility builds and executes
command lines from standard input arguments (usually lists of file
names generated by the find command).
