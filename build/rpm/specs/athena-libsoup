%description
libsoup is an HTTP library implementation in C.  libsoup uses the Glib
main loop and is designed to work well with GTK applications.  This
enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers on the network in a
completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to the Gtk+ programming
model (a synchronous operation mode is also supported for those who
want it).
