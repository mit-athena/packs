%description
saferm is a file removal program which can be used running as root to
safely remove and optionally zero files or direc- tories from
world-writable directories, such as /tmp.  It will refuse to change
directories through symbolic links, and it will not zero files that
have more than one hard link.  Files are zeroed only when the -z
option is speci- fied.  If a directory is being removed, the -d flag
must be specified.  The -q flag suppresses the error message for the
case when a directory cannot be removed because it is not empty.
