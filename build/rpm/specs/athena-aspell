%description 
Aspell is a spelling checker designed to eventually replace Ispell.
Aspell's primary advantage (over Ispell) is a greater skill at
suggesting correct spellings.  Aspell includes both compile-time and
run-time support for non-English languages and can spellcheck (La)TeX
and HTML files.
