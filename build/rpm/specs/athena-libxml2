%description
The athena-libxml2 package contains an XML library, which allows you
to manipulate XML files.  XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a data
format for structured document interchange.  Because libxml version 2
changes the API of libxml and many programs still use libxml version
1, version 2 is canonically distributed and packaged as "libxml2".
