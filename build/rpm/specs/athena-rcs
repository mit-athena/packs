The Revision Control System (RCS) is a system for managing multiple
versions of files.  RCS automates the storage, retrieval, logging,
identification and merging of file revisions.  RCS is useful for text
files that are revised frequently (for example, programs,
documentation, graphics, papers and form letters).
