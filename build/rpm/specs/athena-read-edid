Group: System Environment/Base

%description
The read-edid package contains two programs, get-edid and parse-edid,
which read and display information about the monitor connected to the
system.  For these programs to work, the video card must support VBE
2.0 with the DDC extension, and the monitor must be PnP conformant.

This package contains no documentation.  Generally, you just run
get-edid | parse-edid and look at the results.
