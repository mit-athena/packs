Requires: athena-libathdir

%description
The athdir utility is used to locate specific types of files to a
locker.  It knows about all the conventions for compatibility with
older operating system versions and processor types, and is the
preferred way to determine the correct directory in a locker in which
to find binaries or other architecture-dependent files.
