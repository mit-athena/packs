GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment) is a user-friendly set of
GUI applications and desktop tools to be used in conjunction with a
window manager for the X Window System.  The libgnomeui package
includes GUI-related libraries that are needed to run GNOME.  (The
libgnome package includes the library features that don't use the X
Window System.)
