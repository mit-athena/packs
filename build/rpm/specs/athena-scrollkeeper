%description
ScrollKeeper is a cataloging system for documentation. It manages
documentation metadata (as specified by the Open Source Metadata
Framework (OMF)) and provides a simple API to allow help browsers to
find, sort, and search the document catalog. It will also be able to
communicate with catalog servers on the Net to search for documents
which are not on the local system.
