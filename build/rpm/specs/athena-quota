%description
Quota displays a user's disk usage and limits on local and NFS mounted
file systems, as well as AFS lockers that have been attached. If a
user is specified (by name or by id), quota will return information on
disk usage and limits for that user. Normal users can only check their
own quotas. The super-user may check any quota on local filesystems.
