%description
Bug-buddy is a bug reporting utility for the GNOME desktop GUI
environment.  Bug-buddy can obtain a stack trace from a core file or
crashed application; it can determine the versions of packages
installed on your system; it can be started from gmc (by
double-clicking on a core file) and from the crash dialog; and it
supports the GNOME, KDE, Debian, and Ximian bug tracking systems.
