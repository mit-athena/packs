%description
The traceroute utility displays the route used by IP packets on their
way to a specified network (or Internet) host. Traceroute displays the
IP number and host name (if possible) of the machines along the route
taken by the packets. Traceroute is used as a network debugging
tool. If you are having network connectivity problems, traceroute will
show you where the trouble is coming from along the route.
