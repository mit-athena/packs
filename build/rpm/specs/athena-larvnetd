%description
larvnetd monitors a set of cluster machines and printers given by the
file /etc/athena/larvnet.conf (see larvnet.conf(5)) or a file
specified on the command line with the -f option.  Normally, it
backgrounds itself and dissociates itself from the controlling tty
after binding to the larvnet port, but this behavior can be suppressed
with the -n command-line option.
