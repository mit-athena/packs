%description
This is a small utility to provide feedback when starting X11
applications.  Feedback can be given via four different indicators:
An invisible window (to be used in conjunction with a task pager like
Gnomes tasklist_applet or KDE Taskbar), an generic splashscreen, an
hourglass attached to the mouse cursor or an animated star.
