%description
The delete utility marks files and directories for later permanent
removal by prefixing them with `.#'.  Files accidentally marked for
deletion can be recovered with undelete.  Permanent removal can be
effected immediately with the purge and expunge commands.  The lsdel
utility lists the files that have been marked for deletion but not yet
removed.
