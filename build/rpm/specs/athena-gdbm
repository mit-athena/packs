%description
Gdbm is a GNU database indexing library, including routines which use
extensible hashing.  Gdbm works in a similar way to standard UNIX dbm
routines.  Gdbm is useful for developers who write C applications and
need access to a simple and efficient database or who are building C
applications which will use such a database.
