%description
A modified version of the normal GNU make utility, for use on Athena
workstations.  Athena workstations should normally have this package
installed.

GNU make is a tool for controlling the generation of executables and
other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.
Make allows users to build and install packages without any
significant knowledge about the details of the build process.  The
details about how the program should be built are provided for make in
the program's makefile.
