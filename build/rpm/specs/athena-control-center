%description
GNOME (the GNU Network Object Model Environment) is an attractive and
easy-to-use GUI desktop environment. The control-center package
provides the GNOME Control Center utilities that allow you to setup
and configure your system's GNOME environment (things like the desktop
background and theme, the screensaver, the window manager, system
sounds, and mouse behavior).
