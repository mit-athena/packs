%description
GNOME (the GNU Network Object Model Environment) is an attractive and
easy-to-use GUI desktop environment.  The athena-control-center
package provides the GNOME Control Center utilities, which allow you
to setup and configure your system's GNOME environment (things like
the desktop background and theme, the screensaver, the window manager,
system sounds, and mouse behavior).
