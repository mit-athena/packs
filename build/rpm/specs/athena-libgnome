GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment) is a user-friendly set of
GUI applications and desktop tools to be used in conjunction with a
window manager for the X Window System.  The libgnome package includes
non-GUI-related libraries that are needed to run GNOME.  The
libgnomeui package contains X11-dependent GNOME library features.
