%description
The libpng package contains a library of functions for creating and
manipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format files.  PNG
is a bit-mapped graphics format similar to the GIF format.  PNG was
created to replace the GIF format, since GIF uses a patented data
compression algorithm.
