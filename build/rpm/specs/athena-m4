%description
The normal GNU m4 utility, for use on Athena workstations.  Athena
workstations should normally have this package installed.

GNU m4 is an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro processor.
M4 is useful for writing text files which can be logically parsed, and
is used by many programs as part of their build process.  M4 has
built-in functions for including files, running shell commands, doing
arithmetic, etc.  The autoconf program needs m4 for generating
configure scripts, but not for running configure scripts.
