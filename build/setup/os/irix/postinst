ERROR IN KERNEL CONFIGURATION

The new UNIX kernel is not properly installed on the system, probably as
a result of an autoconfig(1M) failure or due to a lack of sufficient
disk space to create /unix.install. Rebooting the existing /unix kernel
might not work. 

After reading this message and pressing return to continue, when you see
the "Starting up the System" message, press the escape key (possibly several 
times), to go to the prom's system maintenance menu. 

	Select 5) Enter Command Monitor, from the prom menu. 
	Type single at the prom prompt.
	Once in single-user mode:

		autoconfig -v

	If the error message indicates that there is not enough space for 
	autoconfig to successfully create a new kernel, free up some space 
	on / by moving /unix and other unnecessary files on / to another 
	disk.  If the error message refers to undefined symbols, you 
	probably have incompatible products installed.  If you have patches 
	installed, determine if you have all the required patches installed.  
	After the appropriate action has been taken, run autoconfig again.
	Once you have a new kernel in /unix.install, reboot:

		reboot

	You might want to write these instructions down before continuing.
