"A playground for understanding linear system representations and methods 
for analyzing linear dynamic systems.  Linear systems can be entered as 
transfer functions, root lists, poles & zeros, state-space matrices, 
linear graphs, or bond graphs.  Once the system has been entered (a 1 to 
30 second process), it can be analyzed using Bode plots, sinusoid, step, 
ramp, and impulse responses, s-plane, transfer function, and state space 
representations, and nyquist & nichols stability measures.";

help rlocus:
"A quick method of determining the root locus of a system.  This program 
generates the root locus of a system based upon the roots entered in the 
s-plane.  You can easily see the effects of small changes by dragging 
the roots of your system in the s-plane and watching the root locus 
change in real time.  Rlocus also offers a step-by-step tutorial for 
interactively explaining how to derive a root locus.";
