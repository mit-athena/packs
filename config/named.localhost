; Old versions of named allow you to shove authoritative records into
; the database in a primary file outside of the domain the primary
; file is for.  We can exploit this bug to find the MIT name servers
; if the root name servers are down, and to allow people to write
; arbitrary authoritative records into /etc/named.local.  Newer
; versions of named will ignore the following records and anything the
; user is likely to put in named.local.  (See the comments in named.boot
; to find out what to do for local records in that case.  As of release
; 8.1, named.local will work on SGIs but not on Suns.)
