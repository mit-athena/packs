# Syntax for socket-based Internet services:
#  <service_name> <socket_type> <proto> <flags> <user> <server_pathname> <args>
#
# Syntax for TLI-based Internet services:
#
#  <service_name> tli <proto> <flags> <user> <server_pathname> <args>
#
# Echo, discard,  chargen are used primarily for testing.

# RPC services syntax:
#  <rpc_prog>/<vers> <endpoint-type> rpc/<proto> <flags> <user> \
#  <pathname> <args>
#
# <endpoint-type> can be either "tli" or "stream" or "dgram".
# For "stream" and "dgram" assume that the endpoint is a socket descriptor.
# <proto> can be either a nettype or a netid or a "*". The value is
# first treated as a nettype. If it is not a valid nettype then it is
# treated as a netid. The "*" is a short-hand way of saying all the
# transports supported by this system, ie. it equates to the "visible"
# nettype. The syntax for <proto> is:
#	*|<nettype|netid>|<nettype|netid>{[,<nettype|netid>]}
# For example: 
# dummy/1	tli	rpc/circuit_v,udp	wait	root	/tmp/test_svc	test_svc

# System and network administration class agent server
#
# This is referenced by number because the admind agent is needed for the
# initial installation of the system. However, on some preinstalled systems
# the SNAG packages may not be present. Referencing the service by number
# prevents error messages in this case.
