******* NEEDS REVISION *******

Welcome to Project Athena
--------------------------
- Project Athena is an eight-year experiment to explore the use of
  computers in university educational programs.  Initiated in May 1983,
  the project develops computers as useful tools, rather than objects of
  study, in the education of students at MIT. 

- Project Athena seeks to support as much of the MIT student and faculty
  population as possible in a campus-wide distributed service networked 
  workstation environment.

- Project Athena has prepared a set of files, containing information on many
  Athena topics.  The files provide up to date status information on the
  Athena system, summaries of Athena features, as well as instructions
  for learning more about them.  This set of files is kept in a directory
  named `info'.

  Type the following lines (where [CR] means `Hit the RETURN key') to
  learn more about what these files contain and how to read them:

      attach info [CR]
      more /mit/info/README [CR]

- If you have trouble, call X3-4435 to talk to an Athena User Consultant. 
  If there is no consultant on duty, you will get a recording informing you
  of the consulting schedule.

- Documentation is available on line.  In addition, there are reference copies
  in the clusters and copies can be purchased at the Graphic Arts Quick Copy
  Centers: 11-004 and W20-028.  Start with the "Essential" series and the
  documentation catalog.

- To access on-line documentation, just type:  help  followed by a carriage
  return.  The On-Line Help system incorporates lots of information about
  Athena in a menu-based hierarchy that is easy to browse.
 
- Type:  man <program name>  followed by a carriage return to view online
  manual pages for commands.  For example, type:    man ls   to find out 
  how to list your files.  Use man to see the manual pages for other
  useful commands like:  emacs, apropos, and more.
