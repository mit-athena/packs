Welcome to Project Athena
--------------------------
- Project Athena is an eight-year experiment to explore the use of
  computers in university educational programs.  Initiated in May 1983,
  the project develops computers as useful tools, rather than objects of
  study, in the education of students at MIT. 

- Project Athena seeks to support as much of the MIT student and faculty
  population as possible in a campus-wide distributed service networked 
  workstation environment.

- For help about any aspect of Athena, type:   help   followed by a carriage
  return.  This calls the On-Line Help system (OLH), a menu browser that 
  helps you find information about many Athena topics.  (If a topic is not 
  described in detail in OLH, the system system usually provides information 
  on where to find out more about the topic.)  OLH includes:

    - guides to all aspects of the supported Athena environment, including
      how to get an account, how to login and logout, how to work with the 
      UNIX operating system, and how to use some of the most popular
      software on Athena (including software that can help you use Athena
      to write papers or analyze data)

    - up-to-date status information on the Athena system, available Athena
      minicourses, and other current events at Athena

    - stock answers to many commonly asked questions about Athena

    - a complete set of standard UNIX reference modules ("man pages")

- If you have trouble, you can contact an Athena User Consultant.  To get a
  consultant on-line, just type:  olc   followed by a carriage return.  To
  talk to a consultant in person, call X3-4435 (if there is no consultant on 
  duty, you will get a recording informing you of the consulting schedule).
