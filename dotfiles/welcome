Welcome to Athena
-----------------

- Project Athena was an eight-year experiment (1983-1991) to explore the use
  of computers in university educational programs.  The Project focused on
  developing computers as useful tools, rather than as objects of study, in
  the education of students at MIT.

- The Athena system, one of the fruits of Project Athena, is a campus-wide
  distributed computer service consisting of hundreds of networked
  workstations and related facilities (such as printers and file servers)
  available to MIT students and faculty to help them achieve their academic
  goals and learn about computers while at the Institute.

- For help about any aspect of Athena, type:   help   followed by a carriage
  return.  This starts a web browser displaying the home page of the On-Line
  Help system (OLH), which helps you find information about many Athena
  topics.  (If a topic is not described in detail, OLH usually provides
  information on where to find out more about the topic.)  OLH includes:

    - guides to all aspects of the supported Athena environment, including
      how to get an account, how to login and logout, how to work with the
      UNIX operating system, and how to use some of the most popular
      software on Athena (including software that can help you use Athena
      to write papers or analyze data)

    - up-to-date status information on the Athena system, available Athena
      minicourses, and other current events at Athena

    - consultants' stock answers to commonly asked questions about Athena

    - a complete set of standard UNIX reference modules ("man pages")

- If you have trouble, you can contact an Athena User Consultant.  To get a
  consultant on-line, just type:  olc   followed by a carriage return.  To
  talk to a consultant in person, call X3-4435 (if there is no consultant on
  duty, you will get a recording informing you of the consulting schedule).
