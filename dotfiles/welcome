Welcome to Project Athena
--------------------------
- Project Athena is a five-year experiment to explore the use of
  computers in university educational programs.  Initiated in May 1983,
  the project develops computers useful as tools, rather than objects of
  study, in the education of students at MIT. 

- Project Athena seeks to support as much of the MIT student and faculty
  population as possible in a campus-wide network.

- If you have trouble, talk to a student consultant in the nearest
  terminal room.  Consultants wear visors labeled with "Athena
  Consultant" and Athena's symbol, the owl.

- You can find documentation in the terminal rooms or at the IPS
  Publications Office (11-209).  Start with the "Essential" series, the
  quick reference cards, and a documentation catalog.  

- Type:  man <program name>  followed by a carriage return to view
  online manual pages for commands.  For example, type:  man passwd
  to find out how to change your password.  Use man to see the manual
  pages for other useful commands like:  msgs, apropos, more, and ls.
