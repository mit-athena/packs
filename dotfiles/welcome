Welcome to Project Athena
--------------------------
- Project Athena is an eight-year experiment to explore the use of
  computers in university educational programs.  Initiated in May 1983,
  the project develops computers as useful tools, rather than objects of
  study, in the education of students at MIT. 

- Project Athena seeks to support as much of the MIT student and faculty
  population as possible in a campus-wide distributed service networked 
  workstation environment.

- If you have trouble, call X3-4435 to talk to an Athena User Consultant. 
  If there is no consultant on duty, you will get a recording informing you
  of the consulting schedule.

- Documentation is available on line.  In addition, there are reference copies
  in the clusters and copies can be purchased at the Graphic Arts Quick Copy
  Centers: 11-004 and W20-XXX.  Start with the "Essential" series and the
  documentation catalog.

- To access on-line documentation, first attach the athenadoc locker by
  typing:  attach athenadoc  followed by a carriage return. Instructions
  on how to view the documentation are in a file that can be examined by
  typing: more /mit/athenadoc/README 
 
- Type:  man <program name>  followed by a carriage return to view online
  manual pages for commands.  For example, type:  man passwd to find out 
  how to change your password.  Use man to see the manual pages for other
  useful commands like:  emacs, apropos, more, ls and mh.
