.SH NAME
renew - get kerberos tickets, tokens, mappings, zephyr authentication
.SH SYNOPSIS
renew
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIrenew\fR is an alias provided by the standard Athena dotfiles.  It is
intended to make the process of getting new kerberos tickets,
re-authenticating yourself to any fileservers from which you may have
filesystems attached, and re-authenticating yourself to the zephyr
servers easier.

Typing "alias renew" will reveal that renew simply executes the series
of commands:

.ti 12
kinit $USER && fsid -a && zctl load /dev/null

"USER" is an environment variable that is set to your username.
\fIkinit\fR prompts you for your password and gets you a new kerberos
ticket-granting ticket.  Kerberos tickets automatically expire after 10
hours.

\fIfsid -a\fR establishes new NFS mappings and gets new AFS tokens for
any filesystems you have attached.  Valid mappings or tokens are
required to write (and sometimes read) files from remote filesystems.
Mappings and tokens automatically expire after 10 hours.

\fIzctl load /dev/null\fR reauthenticates you to the zephyr servers.
Valid authentication is necessary to receive authentic zephyrgrams;
otherwise, any zephyrgrams you receive will be marked "forged".

The "&&" between the commands means that the command is only executed if
the previous command was successful.  This eliminates error messages
that would occur if something failed; for example, if you mis-type your
password, it will not attempt to get mappings and tokens with no
kerberos tickets, which would print many errors.
